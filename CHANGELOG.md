## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-28

- Night-light indicator and control driven by sunsetr's event socket instead
  of polling or hyprsunset.
- Icon color runs cool -> warm with sunsetr's live color temperature; opacity
  tracks gamma. Collapses to zero width at true peak daytime.
- Left-click toggles forced day/night (or back to automatic); middle-click
  refreshes; right-click opens an info popup with status, period countdown,
  and an Auto/Day/Night switch.
- Forcing day/night fades in via sunsetr's per-preset `smoothing`/
  `startup_duration` fields instead of jumping instantly.
- `sunsetr-nightlight` CLI for keybindings
  (`toggle|on|off|auto|status|start|stop|refresh`).
- `bin/setup` installer: creates `day`/`night` presets, symlinks the CLI,
  removes the stock NightLight indicator, adds a toggle menu override, and
  enables the plugin. Idempotent, with `--yes`/`--uninstall` support and
  timestamped backups of every file it touches.
